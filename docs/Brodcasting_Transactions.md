# Brodcasting Transactions

To brodcast a transaction a wallet has to have a connection to an active node. This transaction is then brodcasted to the node. The node then checks if the transaction is valid. If it is valid the node brodcasts the transaction to the other nodes. These nodes then check the transaction and if it is valid brodcast it to their known nodes.
